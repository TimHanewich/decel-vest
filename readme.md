# Deceleration Vest
Detecting deceleration while in/on a vehicle from wearing an MPU6050 accelerometer.

## Raspberry Pi Pico Tips
- Great youtube videos on getting started:

- Using **rshell**
    - To copy contents of a folder to another folder
        - `cp MyCodeFolder/* /pyboard/`

    - The **imu** and **vector3d** class aparently will work with the MPU6050: https://github.com/micropython-IMU/micropython-mpu9x50
- Using the *machine* module in MicroPython: https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/library/machine.html

## Example of using MPU6050 module with MicroPython (from peppe8o)
```
from imu import MPU6050
import time
from machine import Pin, I2C

i2c = I2C(0, sda=Pin(4), scl=Pin(5), freq=400000)
imu = MPU6050(i2c)

while True:
    # Following print shows original data get from libary. You can uncomment to see raw data
    #print(imu.accel.xyz,imu.gyro.xyz,imu.temperature,end='\r')
    
    # Following rows round values get for a more pretty print:
    ax=round(imu.accel.x,2)
    ay=round(imu.accel.y,2)
    az=round(imu.accel.z,2)
    gx=round(imu.gyro.x)
    gy=round(imu.gyro.y)
    gz=round(imu.gyro.z)
    tem=round(imu.temperature,2)
    print(ax,"\t",ay,"\t",az,"\t",gx,"\t",gy,"\t",gz,"\t",tem,"        ",end="\r")
    
    # Following sleep statement makes values enought stable to be seen and
    # read by a human from shell
    time.sleep(0.2)
```

## The need for MicroPython Double Precision
By default, only single float precision is enabled in micropython. For the GPS-related calculations (distance between two points that uses sin, cos, acos, etc), we need to use double precision numbers. 

[MicroPython 1.19.1 with Double Precision floating point numbers enabled (not the default single precision)](micropython-1.19.1-double-precision.uf2)

This article describes how to do this. These are the steps I followed: https://community.element14.com/products/raspberry-pi/b/blog/posts/pi-pico-rp2040-micropython-double-precision

## Using CSV files with MicroPython
For whatever reason, MicroPython reads the new lines in a CSV file that is generated by Excel as \r, not \n. So reading a single line with file.readline() doesn't work, it tries to read the whole file. To fix this, copy and paste the content from an Excel-saved CSV file into another CSV file (text editor). MicroPython will be able to read the new line in that file.

## Code for recording raw and processed data:
```
import gps_driver
import nmea
import _thread
from machine import Pin
import speed_controller
import dlogging

# Turn on the LED
led = Pin(25, Pin.OUT)
led.value(1)

# create the variables that we will use
sc = speed_controller.speed_controller()

# print the headers
dlogging.log("fix_speed_lat_lon_sats", False)

# write the function that will handle the receiving of gps
def process_gps_tele(tele:nmea.gps_telemetry):
    global sc
    if tele != None:
        if tele.fixed != None and tele.latitude != None and tele.longitude != None:
            sc.ingest(tele.fixed, tele.latitude, tele.longitude)
    
    dlogging.log(str(tele.fixed) + "_" + str(sc.speed_mph) + "_" + str(tele.latitude) + "_" + str(tele.longitude) + "_" + str(tele.satellites))

# start the gps driver
gps = gps_driver.gps_driver()
gps.set_callback(process_gps_tele)
_thread.start_new_thread(gps.start(), ())
```

## The Transistor-boosted LED light current:
Current draw from the battery is 0.15A using the DC-DC boost converter (~3.25V to 11.5V).
The LED bulb normally only draws 0.041A, but it draws more current due to the need to boost the voltage.
The current draw into the transistor base (from the GPIO pin) is < 0.001A, extremely small. But **NEEDS TO GO THROUGH A 10,000 OHM RESISTOR**!
